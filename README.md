# Palindrome using data structures

A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same forwards as it does backwards. For
example, “a man, a plan, a canal, Panama,” is a palindrome.
A string is said to be a palindrome if the string read from left to right is equal to the
string read from right to left. A string is said to be a palindrome if the string read from left
to right is equal to the string read from right to left. For example, ignoring the difference
between uppercase and lowercase letters, the string "iTopiNonAvevanoNipoti" is a
palindrome, while the string "iGattiNonAvevanoCugini" is not so.
The following is an inductive characterization of a palindrome string:
 the empty string is a palindrome;
 a string constituted only by a single character is a palindrome;
 a string c s d is a palindrome, if s is a palindrome and c is a character equal to d;
 nothing else is a palindrome
The purpose of using palindromes in writing, words, numbers, and sentences is to
create light entertainment and fun. It is not just a chance that, biologically, our genes are
also palindromes – that their order is the same, forward and backward
Now here in this project we are going to detect if the given sentence or string is
palindrome or not using the java program including some data structures.

Input:
a dog a panicin a pagoda 
Was it a car or a cat I sa

Output:
a dog a panicin a pagoda is a palindrome
Was it a car or a cat I sa is not a palindrome
